  data type:
  
   premitive data type												non-premitive data type

																		 array			
non numric data       numric data										 string... etc..	

char    :''       Integeral type   Floating point 
boolean : false   
                     byte             float
                     short            double

  encpasulation
   class object
   constructor, data hiding, access modifiers,non access modifiers
  
  class : object
  
  class : class is collection of data member and member functions | class is blue print of an object
  object: object is an real world entity of class | identity of class
  
  School class --> students,fac,mang,.///
  Product class -> color,price,.....
  
  
  class arch respect to JVM:
  
  
  inheritacnce
  :	
  polymorephisam
  : compile | run 
  		method overloading | method overriding
  abstraction
  	abstract class| interface
  	
  	
polymorephisam:

many form of function
compile time :
	overloading
run time 
	method overriding
	
	
method overloading
same name of function with diff argument with diff data type	


method overriding:

parent class method create in child class with same signature called method overriding...

signature:
name
access | non access modifiers
param
return type



abstraction:
hide specfic data


exam paper : -->
abstraction : 
abscract class : abstract method
interface:




non access modifiers
Static : 
Final  :
Abstract :
Synchronized : thread
transient : 
strictfp  :
native    :

----------------------------------------

create 2 methods...
1st method
get data from user 5 elements store in array
2nd method
printy data available in array..


//royal time table..
Monday -->java,cpp
Tuesaday -->java,python


Wrapper :all data type have it wrapper class...
int Integer
float Float



exception handling....
Exception                                    Error

exception will stop continues    Error is syntax issue... 
flow of your program


compile time and runtime exception
checked exception | unchecked exception

run time exception : developer logical issue,
hardware issue memory isuee..


error must resolve..
and exception have to handle...

									Throwable[c]
				
				Exception[c]                                 Error[c]
				   RunTimeException[c]                          
				      .
				      .
				       
				   IoException[c]
				      .
				      .
				      .
				      .					
									

how to handle exception:
1) using try catch and finally block..
2) using throws keyword...


checked exception:

compile time exception:

any builtin method or udf methods throws xception then we have to handle that exception
